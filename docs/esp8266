1. GPIO2 must be High at start-up and it is, so leave it open
2. GPIO0 decides normal boot/flash mode. High (default) is normal boot, so nothin need to be done for normal boot. For flash mode - pull-down the pin to GND with 10K resistor
3. GPIO15 must be Pulled-Down to GND with 10K resistor (adapter already does this)
4. CH_PD must be Pulled-UP to VCC with 10K resistor (adapter already does this)
5. GPIO16 must be connected to RST with 330 Ohm to enable wake-up from deep sleep

For flashing use USB programmer with logo 'BAITE' on it and betemcu.cn printed on it
 - Set voltage to 3.3 on programmer (a switch)
 - connect to ESP8266: RXD->TXD, TXD->RXD, GND->GND.
 - power source for ESP8266 can be external (~ 3.3 volts), but make sure that GND is common with programmer
